# T.O.P DSA and CS concepts [Lessons][https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#a-bit-of-computer-science]

### This was quite mind numbin'

Took quite some time to get through it all, cs concepts are quite complex.
Need to practice more on recursion and I need to get better at problem solving.

Learning BFS and DFS both through bst and knight-travails was a real eye opening
experience, now I can confidently say I can somewhat do dfs and bfs. ^_^
